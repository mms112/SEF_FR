[HeavyBodyArmor]
Description=This ceramic plate armor provides Level III protection from ballistic penetrations.  Even when hit with FMJ rounds, it provides exceptional protection from pistols, submachineguns, 7.62 rifles and armor piercing shotgun slugs.  However, the ceramic plates only can reliably stop one impact, after that they start to break, reducing the armor's ballistic protection.  The thickness and bulk of the vest reduce the effects of Sting grenades and the less lethal shotgun by half, but reduce an officer's mobility and slowdown his actions.
